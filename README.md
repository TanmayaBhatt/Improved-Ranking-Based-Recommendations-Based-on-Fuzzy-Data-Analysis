# Improved-Ranking-Based-Recommendations-Based-on-Fuzzy-Data-Analysis
Recommender system is a personalized information filtering technique used to identify desired number of items based on interests of a user. It is based on past behaviour , relations to other users , item similarity and context. A system is developed using past user ratings by applying different techniques. The techniques focus on improving the accuracy of the recommendations and other important aspects of recommendation quality, such as the diversity of recommendations. Fuzzy systems are used to solve the data analysis problems with the main aim of creating models for predictions and interpretation. In this paper we aim to improve recommendations by fuzzifying a TripAdvisor dataset.
